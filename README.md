# Visual Misinformation in Vision-Language Models

This repository contains the code and dataset for the paper *"Propensity to Trust in Large Language Models"*.

The project investigates how the presence of images influences misinformation resharing behavior in vision-language models (VLMs). It includes simulation tools for persona conditioning, prompt construction, model interfacing, and statistical analysis.


## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/`: Main source code.
  - `main_exec.py`: Entry point for running simulations.
  - `load_cnfg.py`: Loads experiment configurations and parameters.
  - `complete.py`, `models.py`: Interfaces and wrappers for VLMs.
  - `prompt.py`: Constructs prompts for input to VLMs.
  - `conversation.py`: Manages dialogue flow and response collection.
  - `crawl.py`: Scrapes news articles from PolitiFact.
  - `classify_img.py`, `classify_news.py`, `clean_data.py`: Preprocess and classify news data and associated images.
  - `save_res.py`, `scan_res.py`: Save and aggregate experimental results.
  - `infstat.py`, `plot.py`: Statistical analysis and plotting utilities.

- `data/`: Input data.
  - `dialogs_user.json`: Prompt templates using third-person framing.
  - `dialogs_asst.json`: Prompt templates using second-person framing.
  - `demo_small.json`: Demographic attribute definitions.
  - `news_200.json`: Text content of the news dataset.
  - `trait.json`: Trait keyword definitions for persona prompts.
  - `.key.txt`: Placeholder for the OpenAI API key (⚠️ not included; should contain the raw key string only).
  - `.anth.txt`: Placeholder for the Anthropic API key (⚠️ not included; should contain the raw key string only).
  - `.hf.txt`: Placeholder for the Hugging Face API token (⚠️ not included; should contain the raw key string only).


-   `imgs/`: News-related images used in the dataset (provided empty). Available at: [Download 200-News Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U3HPyt4NktwLExbcwWQZNLCH4uMwiyW_)


-   `res/`: Stores the results generated from simulation runs (provided empty).

-   `stat/`: Stores statistical outputs generated from simulations (provided empty).



## ⚙️ Requirements
This project uses `Python 3.12.3`. You can install dependencies via:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 📦 Dataset

The dataset of 200 news items is available at the following link:

🔗 [Download 200-News Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U3HPyt4NktwLExbcwWQZNLCH4uMwiyW_)

After downloading, place the `imgs/` folder at the same level as the `src/` and `data/` directories.

The corresponding text data (`news_200.json`) is already included in the `data/` directory.

**Disclaimer:** This dataset contains material (such as text and images) that may be protected by copyright and owned by third parties. We do not claim any rights over such content.

## 🚀 Running the Code

To view available command-line arguments, use the `-h` flag:

```
$ python3 main_exec.py -h
```

Use the `-v` option to visualize simulation progress across news items.

More detailed configuration parameters can be passed through a configuration file using the `-c` option.

For example, `cnfg_gpt.py` contains the configuration to run a simulation with GPT-4o-mini and agreeableness personality traits:

```
$ python3 main_exec.py -c cnfg_gpt -v
```

Another example, `cnfg_cld.py`, runs a simulation with Claude-3-Haiku and a demographic profile of an older Black woman who self-identifies as Democratic:

```
$ python3 main_exec.py -c cnfg_cld -v
```
